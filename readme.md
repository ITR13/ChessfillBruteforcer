[b]Warning[/b]
Very messy code ahead. Half of this was written while half-asleep.
I also wrote all of it in notepad++.
And for some reason decided to not use any of the website hosting libraries I know how to use.
And to write all the html inline, and all the css inline in the html.
And a dozen more bad design patterns, too much effort to list them all.

[b]How to use[/b]
To start brute-forcing run `chessfill.py 12` with python 3.7 or higher (may work for some lower versions too)
To start the server run `server.py` in the same version.

Both can run at the same time.
The digit after chessfill.py decides how many layers deep of progress-bars to use.

Don't think any of this is going to be useful to anyone, but any code not stolen from stack overflow may be considered released to the public domain.
